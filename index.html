                    Certified Technician with over two years of experience currently going to school to gain
                    more engineering knowledge. Before i found my talent as a Technician i was a Mechanic.
                    Every sunny day i wasn't working was most likely spent in the garage working on my ride. I'm not
                    gunna lie i did get frusterated
                    at some points, but no matter how difficult it got nothing took away the satisfaction of fixing the
                    code at the end of the day.
                    I like to test my work at Sanoma Raceway to drag race. Before my drag racing days i did a lot of
                    photography. People admired my photos
                    and asked to do photoshoots of them with their race cars. When i'm not racing or at school i'm most
                    likely taking
                    a walk with my dogs. My first job was with Pep Boys in Commercial Sales. I was able to use my car
                    knowledge and apply them at work, but as a female i found out quickly
                    that my knowledge was questioned. After a while i got annoyed of peoples opinion and figured i need
                    to change my field to
                    something where my knowledge wouldn't be questioned and valued regardless of the sex. I joined a
                    nine month program at Unitek College
                    and went over Hardware, Software, Networking, Security, Vlan, Server, Cloud and Desk Support. I
                    graduated with a Certification of
                    Completion in Information Technology. That helped me get my foot into Google through a vendor
                    company. After a year of being with
                    Google I learned that a lot of big companies like Facebook and Google hire most of their workers
                    through vendor companies which are highly underpaid
                    compared to white badge Google Employees.
                    I found it hard as a vendor to be able to grow in the company, so i was motivated to go back to
                    school so i can be able to apply to any engineering position.
                    My goal after this boot camp is to apply back to Google and become a white badge employee. So far in
                    this boot camp i've learned
                    soo much and can't wait to master the art and become a professional developer.
